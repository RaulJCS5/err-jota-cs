        <h2>Hi, I am a software developer 👨‍💻 with a passion ❤ for creating innovative and efficient solutions. I have a firm background in various programming languages and technologies, and I am skilled in front-end and back-end development. I am comfortable taking on new challenges and learning new technologies. I am always eager to learn and grow as a software developer. But when I'm not in front of a computer, I love to blow off steam by playing football⚽ or getting out in nature🌳 for some challenging outdoor exercise💪 also I love swimming🏊‍♂️, and just being near the water🌊 I feel a deep sense of joy and connection.</h2>
