      <Typography variant='h6'>Hello, I am a software developer excited to create innovative and efficient solutions. I have a solid background in various programming languages and technologies and talents in front-end and back-end development. I am comfortable taking on new challenges and learning new technologies.</Typography>
      <Typography variant='h6'>I am always eager to learn and grow as a software developer. When I'm not in front of a computer, I have a deep sense of joy and connection with the water, so I like to do water sports such as swimming and cliff jumping in the water, and my hobbies are playing football or getting out in nature for some challenging hiking or others outdoor exercise.</Typography>
